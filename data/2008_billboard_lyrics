1,Closed off from love I didnt need the pain Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain Time starts to pass before you know it youre frozen But something happened for the very first time with you My heart melted to the ground Found something true And everyones looking round thinking Im going crazy  But I dont care what they say Im in love with you They try to pull me away but they dont know the truth My hearts crippled by the vein that I keep on closing You cut me open and I  Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love I keep bleeding I keep keep bleeding love Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love You cut me open  Trying hard not to hear but they talk so loud Their piercing sounds fill my ears try to fill me with doubt Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from falling But nothings greater than the risk That comes with your embrace And in this world of loneliness I see your face Yet everyone around me thinks that Im going crazy Maybe maybe  But I dont care what they say Im in love with you They try to pull me away but they dont know the truth My hearts crippled by the vein that I keep on closing You cut me open and I  Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love I keep bleeding I keep keep bleeding love Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love You cut me open  And its draining all of me Though they find it hard to believe Ill be wearing these scars for everyone to see  But I dont care what they say Im in love with you They try to pull me away but they dont know the truth My hearts crippled by the vein that I keep on closing You cut me open and I  Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love I keep bleeding I keep keep bleeding love Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love (Ooh you cut me open and I) Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love I keep bleeding I keep keep bleeding love Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love  Ooh you cut me open and I Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love
