5,Right from the start You were a thief you stole my heart And I your willing victim I let you see the parts of me That werent all that pretty And with every touch you fixed them Now youve been talking in your sleep Oh oh Things you never say to me Oh oh Tell me that youve had enough Of our love our love  Just give me a reason Just a little bits enough Just a second   were not broken just bent And we can learn to love again Its in the stars Its been written in the scars on our hearts Were not broken just bent And we can learn to love again  Im sorry I dont understand where all of this is coming from I thought that we were fine (Oh we had everything) Your head is running wild again My dear we still have everything And its all in your mind (Yeah but this is happening) Now youve been having real bad dreams Oh oh You used to lie so close to me Oh oh Theres nothing more than empty sheets Between our love our love Oh our love our love love  Just give me a reason Just a little bit’s enoughJust a second   we’re not broken just bent And we can learn to love again I’ve never stopped You’re still written in the scars on my heart You’re not broken just bent And we can learn to love again  Oh tears ducts and rust Ill fix it for us Were collecting dust but our loves enough Youre holding it in Youre pouring a drink No nothing is as bad as it seems Well come clean  Just give me a reason Just a little bits enough Just a second were not broken just bent And we can learn to love again Its in the stars Its been written in the scars on our hearts That were not broken just bent And we can learn to love again  Just give me a reason Just a little bits enough Just a second were not broken just bent And we can learn to love again Its in the stars Its still written in the scars on our hearts That were not broken just bent And we can learn to love again  Oh can learn to love again Oh can learn to love again Oh That were not broken just bent And we can learn to love again
6,Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now Our song on the radio but it dont sound the same When our friends talk about you all it does is just tear me down Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name  It all just sounds like oooooh ooh Mmm too young too dumb to realize  That I should have bought you flowers And held your hand Should have gave you all my hours When I had the chance Take you to every party Cause all you wanted to do was dance Now my babys dancing But shes dancing with another man  My pride my ego my needs and my selfish ways Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life Now Ill never never get to clean up the mess I made (oh) And it haunts me every time I close my eyes  It all just sounds like oooooh ooh Mmm too young too dumb to realize  That I should have bought you flowers And held your hand Should have gave you all my hours When I had the chance Take you to every party Cause all you wanted to do was dance Now my babys dancing But shes dancing with another man  Although it hurts Ill be the first to say that I was wrong Oh I know Im probably much too late To try and apologize for my mistakes But I just want you to know  I hope he buys you flowers I hope he holds your hand Give you all his hours When he has the chance Take you to every party Cause I remember how much you loved to dance Do all the things I should have done When I was your man  Do all the things I should have done When I was your man
7,The mixtapes got a little Hank little Drake So says country superstar duo Florida Georgia Line in their smash single from the spring of 2014 “This Is How We Roll”  This is not just an empty boast either  Listen to the second verse while imagining Drake as a white Southern bro country artist: Up on them 37 Nittos windows tinted hard to see though  Them kisses are for me though automatic like a free throw This life I live it might not be for you but its for me though Not only is the rhetoric Drake worthy – extolling the virtues of a uniquely superior lifestyle   but the way he rhymes “though” using a slang pronunciation three times in close succession why it even sounds like Drake! On another track their “Cruise Remix” video featuring Nelly Florida Georgia Line also supply imagery indicative of their genre blending  While some rap music has long been accused of focusing on cash cars drugs and women FGL show that this is redneck thematic territory as well; just observe the expensive rides and seductively southern dames: Likewise through artful alliteration the boys name drop their party drink as well: She was sippin on Southern and singin Marshall Tucker And this is all before we get to Nelly’s impassioned verse which he contributes according to the video’s opening scene to help them learn how to “turn up”  Judging by “This Is How We Roll” as a follow up it is obvious FGL have learned the lesson well –  so well that they have been influenced even by the structure of Hip Hop bringing in one of their homies for a guest verse: Luke Bryan himself known to get turnt by mixing a little Conway with some T Pain every once in a while Some people though are instead turning this trend down While peeping their video on YouTube reveals over 16 million views (as of 7/17/14) the comments section is filled with vitriolic rants  One such comment puts it this way: “Hick Hop Manufactured lame corporate horse crap This is a disgrace to country music Johnny Cash is rolling over in his grave right now” Really The same Johnny Cash who was the OG Southern thug!  The same Johnny Cash who put so much conviction into singing lines like: I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down When I was arrested I was dressed in black I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die We’re talking the “Man In Black” himself! I think he’d welcome the chance were he still alive to pal around with some new school gangsters and presented with an opportunity for a remix would probably choose to turn up instead of turn it down!
8,I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath Scared to rock the boat and make a mess So I sat quietly agreed politely I guess that I forgot I had a choice I let you push me past the breaking point I stood for nothing so I fell for everything  You held me down but I got up (hey) Already brushing off the dust You hear my voice your hear that sound Like thunder gonna shake the ground You held me down but I got up Get ready cause I had enough I see it all I see it now  I got the eye of the tiger a fighter Dancing through the fire Cause I am a champion and you’re gonna hear me roar Louder louder than a lion Cause I am a champion and you’re gonna hear me roar  Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh You’re gonna hear me roar  Now I’m floating like a butterfly Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes I went from zero to my own hero  You held me down but I got up (hey) Already brushing off the dust You hear my voice your hear that sound Like thunder gonna shake the ground You held me down but I got up Get ready cause I had enough I see it all I see it now  I got the eye of the tiger a fighter Dancing through the fire Cause I am a champion and you’re gonna hear me roar Louder louder than a lion Cause I am a champion and you’re gonna hear me roar  Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh You’re gonna hear me roar  Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Youll hear me roar) Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh You’re gonna hear me roar  Roar roar roar roar roar  I got the eye of the tiger a fighter Dancing through the fire Cause I am a champion and you’re gonna hear me roar Louder louder than a lion Cause I am a champion and you’re gonna hear me roar  Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh You’re gonna hear me roar  Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Youll hear me roar) Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh You’re gonna hear me roar

37,Hi I’m the Rap Critic Well… Lil Wayne has a new single and it’s called “Love Me” Well with a title like that I don’t know what to expect However after “How to Love” turned out to be an awkward but slightly admirable ballad about a girl going through a hard life maybe a song titled “Love Me” would be a more personal number Contemplating his personal struggles with trust and relationships And yeah it could just be another crappy bragging song but I like to be optimistic when I go into a review So what That’s not the full title of the song What’s the full title of the song Drake: Bitches love me Man I feel stupid Well let’s get this over with Future: I’m on that good kush and alcohol  stupid unnecessary audio watermark for the producer  *sneers* I don’t know what I was doing  Wait What was that thing she’s wearing Is that a stylized version of a scolds bridle A mild torture device that men put on women in the middle ages when they felt they were talking too much Wow we’ve wasted no time into getting into some pretty dark territory haven’t we I mean… you know what I haven’t even started talking about the lyrics yet I’m just gonna let this one go Okay so this song which sounds more like a mockingbird type lullaby than a club hit is about being drunk and high and calling a couple girls to have sex And…maybe these girls are just into really kinky stuff! Like you know headgear to remind them of a time when women were seen as even less inferior than we treat them now Or swing sets Yeah… Future: Imma ball ‘til the day I fall One more thing before we continue When did this Future character here a guy who barely passes as a rapper let alone a singer become credible enough in the industry to be featured chorus guy I mean according to what I’m seeing on the lyric sheet he has no verse! So without his own full verse the only appeal to having him on the song is purely based off of his ability to carry a hook And I’m not sure if you’ve noticed but… (shows a cover of the single for “Loveeee Song” by Future and Rihanna as that song plays) Future isn’t exactly a powerhouse vocalist I mean could Lil Wayne honestly not be bothered to do the auto tune on his own hooks Aren’t you still friends with T Pain At least that guy has some personality this guy is… huh Funny that a guy named Future is relying on a vocal effect that’s near extinction I mean when even T Pain says T Pain: Auto tune is on its way out! Back in 2008 I think it’s over as a gimmick that people can take seriously But back to the song Drake: Long as my bitches love my bitches love Wait now Drake is on the chorus Is this the Drake and Future collaboration the world was waiting for He doesn’t have a verse either so I can only assume that there was a large enough audience out there that would be oh so content enough to hear the musical style blending off the rapping personifications of both boring and uninteresting But forgive me again we need to get back to the song Drake: I can give a fuck ‘bout no hater Long as my bitches love me So the song is about how he doesn’t care how many people dislike him as long as there are women willing to have sex with him Which is typical but for some reason in this song he’s more like an ineffective defense mechanism than cocky confident braggadocio Actually listen to the song without the arrogant too cool to care faces in the music video And really listen to their voices: Future: I’m on that good kush and alcohol I got some down bitches I can call Is there anything in his voice that indicates that he is in any way happy about his life of excess I mean if this was one of those songs where they were trying to make a statement about how empty that kind of life is that would be perfect but it’s not And usually failings in the vocal melody can be excused by a beat that’s full of vigor and 808 but he can’t do that here since every time the chorus comes in the beat gets that same muffled and muted effect that’s present on nearly every friggin’ song featuring Drake and since the vocalists are all you have to go on when this happens their lifeless delivery stops the song dead! Drake: I can give a fuck ‘bout no hater Long as my bitches love me Does he actually sound convinced here Does he legitimately sound like he doesn’t care about haters I don’t know about you guys but to me it sounds like he’s reverting to irrelevant boasting about superficial accomplishments intended to shield his ego after reading a scathing review of his music that sincerely struck a nerve All I hear is a couple of insecure men masking their weaknesses with boasts of sexual prowess! And we haven’t even gotten to the verses yet! Lil Wayne: Pussy ass niggas stop hating So you don’t care about haters in any way shape or form and only care about your women but the first thing you do in your verse is address the haters Because you know what better way to show that you don’t care about someone than by constantly mentioning them (montage of Wayne mentioning haters throughout the song) I don’t know about you but there’s something slightly contradictory about shouting “HEY ALL YOU HATERS! PAY ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT I DON’T CARE ABOUT YOU!” Lil Wayne: Lil Tunechi got that fire And these hoes love me like Satan man! D do hoes like Satan I mean I know hoes are known for having questionable morality but I don’t think anyone actively likes Satan I don’t even think Satanists likes Satan they just do it to piss off Christians I mean I know you’re trying to relate the Satan and fire thing but hoes don’t like fire either! Lil Wayne: And these hoes love me like Satan man! You know believe it or not but some people think that this little snippet is proof positive that Lil Wayne is part of some demonic cult And honestly if you think some post production CGI inspired by a barely thought out lyric is the proof you need to think Lil Wayne works for the devil then he does work for the devil and he’s going to kill you Lil Wayne: Fuck with me and get bodied And all she eat is dick she’s on a strict diet You don’t know how segways work do you I mean what thought process takes you from “I’m going to kill you!” to “This chick is all about my penis” For real! The only piece of transitional material we get is the word “and” And I don’t know about you but linking two phrases together with the word “and” is not the same as a transitional phrase and I like nipples Lil Wayne: She don’t want money She wants the time we could spend Pfft Yeah okay Lose all your money to tax evasion and see if all your bitches still want to spend time with you! Lil Wayne: She said “I never wanna make you mad I just wanna make you proud” I said “Baby just make me cum Then don’t make a sound” Okay… I’m I’m trying to explain what’s wrong with these lines and what disturbs me about them Because it’s not just about the fact that they’re objectifying the girl in question No that’s to be expected with Wayne But it’s the fact that this couplet communicates something more unsettling than that And I just want to play these lyrics again and ask you a question: Lil Wayne: She said “I never wanna make you mad I just wanna make you proud” I said “Baby just make me cum Then don’t make a sound” In what way does this NOT sound like an abusive relationship In what way is this not a controlling sociopath dominating over a woman who’s afraid of giving him any excuse to lash out in anger at her I mean it’s not overtly stating it but it’s definitely implied (sees a shot of a woman in the scolds bridle) Wow That is not helping But anyway in his episode of Behind the Music he talked about how he freestyles everything because it feels more real to him and that everything he says honestly speaks to how his mind works because of that If this is true it says very disturbing things about him that he considers this as an honest expression of himself And you know what He’s an artist and an artist telling you about his perspective doesnt always have to be a positive thing But my problem lies not in his questionable morals…well actually yes it does but it’s the fact that after so many girls hear his music and hear this song in particular plenty of his female fans are still willing to be his groupies in late night booty calls! I mean he’s making no bones about the fact that he doesn’t respect you so at this point if you’re still trying to get with him your motivations are probably no better than his and I think you know what I mean when I talk about the motivations of these types of women You know those women always wanting to spend all of your time… Lil Wayne: She wants the time we could spend *scoff* Heartless succubus But hey maybe he’s not that bad Maybe when he’s with these women he’s actually respectful of the I’m sorry are there women in cages like circus animals So…let me get this straight Lupe Fiasco makes a song that barely charts talking about how women should not be purely viewed as sex objects and should hold themselves to a higher standard and he’s accused of still bringing up patriarchal views on sexuality and all that stuff But Lil Wayne has a top 10 hit with a music video where women are viewed as beasts in circus cages! With lines like Lil Wayne: I said “Baby just make me cum Then don’t make a sound” And… nobody’s making a stink about this! I’m not saying it should be pulled off the air or anything I just think it’s odd that a video with good intentions got crapped on while a video that can be easily interpreted as equating female sexuality with being entertained by animals is okay But where was I Oh yes So like I was saying I’m sure in real life Wayne is very respectful to women… Lil Wayne: These hoes got pussies like craters Damn! That…that imagery! Again to all the women still wanting to have sex with Lil Wayne: THIS is what he metaphorically thinks of your vaginas! *picture of a crater* So…I think he’s really trying to get across the point that he thinks you’re all whores! Lil Wayne: Can’t treat these hoes like ladies man! Hey…who do you treat like a lady Because by acknowledging the idea of lady you’re acknowledging that women can achieve a respectable status But none of the girls you’ve ever met have achieved that status in your head So it’s not that you’re saying that all women are whores; you’re just saying that all women you refer to are whores Hmm I wonder how that works for other things I’m not saying that all Chinese people are good at math play piano and know Kung Fu I’m just saying that all the Chinese people I’m ever going to refer to are good at math play piano and know Kung where’s everybody going Lil Wayne: Pussy money weed codeine Was that a lyric or just a reminder of all the topics he has to stick to Lil Wayne: She wake up eat this dick Call that breakfast in bed: 69 96 Wait What do those last numbers have to do with anything Are you saying that you and her are 69’ing each other Well that doesn’t work since you only mention that she’s going down on you! And what is 96 supposed to mean! Do you know why it’s called 69 Wayne Because the numbers vaguely resemble two people orally stimulating each other So what is 96 supposed to represent Two people…facing away from each other What are they lying on each other’s butts That makes no sense! Lil Wayne: I feel her heartbeat It’s a little late to get romantic don’t you think Lil Wayne: I chest to chest with this bitch Yeah I thought so Lil Wayne: Yeah all my bitches love me and I love all my bitches But it’s like as soon as I cum I come to my senses Hold on a minute maybe the song’s trying to say something Maybe this whole song is just trying to communicate that meaningless sex with random women doesn’t actually lead to a fulfilling life And maybe eating less is a good way to get fiber in your diet! Of course there’s no real revelation he just continues to talk about haters and hoes Lil Wayne: Now kiss my ass if you hatin I’m getting ass or I’m skating Anything that keeps you from playing the guitar *shows a scene of Wayne playing the guitar live* Yeah keep hitting those two notes buddy I’m sure the people who play the Beginner mode on Guitar Hero are impressed Yeah overall this gets a 0 out of 5 from me The melancholy beat sounds too dark to be a club song which is partially what ruins the atmosphere of it And the chorus fails to do anything that makes up for the dark tone of the beat! And his rhymes are terrible There’s no wordplay here that’s clever enough to save him from being this unbearably sexist It crosses the line of being a regular sex anthem into a grotesque assertion of male dominance And ultimately does not make for a good listening experience And that’s pretty much all I have to say about that Well I’m the Rap Critic You don’t have to like my opinion but I don’t have to like your song (post outro scene) I don’t know about you but there’s something slightly contradictory about saying “HEY ALL YOU HATERS! PAY ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT I DON’T CARE ABOUT YOU!” (Someone in the distance: OKAY!) *chuckles*

Trippin yeah I guess she had a point didnt she A bunch of stereotypes all in my head I remember doing the math like Yeah Im good at little league A pre conceived idea of what it all meant For those that like the same sex had the characteristics The right wing conservatives think its a decision And you can be cured with some treatment and religion Man made rewiring of a pre disposition Playing God aw nah here we go America the brave still fears what we dont know And God loves all his children is somehow forgotten But we paraphrase a book written thirty five hundred years ago I dont know  And I cant change even if I tried Even if I wanted to And I cant change even if I tried Even if I wanted to My love my love my love She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm  If I was gay I would think hip hop hates me Have you read the YouTube comments lately Man thats gay gets dropped on the daily Weve become so numb to what were sayin Our culture founded from oppression Yet we dont have acceptance for em Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board A word rooted in hate yet our genre still ignores it Gay is synonymous with the lesser Its the same hate thats caused wars from religion Gender to skin color the complexion of your pigment The same fight that led people to walk outs and sit ins Its human rights for everybody there is no difference Live on and be yourself When I was at church they taught me something else If you preach hate at the service those words arent anointed That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen I might not be the same but thats not important No freedom til were equal damn right I support it   And I cant change even if I tried Even if I wanted to And I cant change even if I tried Even if I wanted to My love my love my love She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm  We press play dont press pause: progress march on!

83,I cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors I screamed his name ‘til the neighbours called the cops I numbed the pain at the expense of my liver Don’t know what I did next all I know I couldn’t stop  Word got around to the barflies and the baptists My mama’s phone started ringing off the hook I can hear her now saying she ain’t gonna have it Don’t matter how you feel it only matters how you look  Go and fix your make up girl it’s just a break up Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady Cause I raised you better gotta keep it together Even when you fall apart But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart  Wish I could be just a little less dramatic Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames Leave it to me to be holding the matches When the fire trucks show up and there’s nobody else to blame  Can’t get revenge and keep a spotless reputation Sometimes revenges just a choice you gotta make My mama came from a softer generation Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face  Go and fix your make up girl it’s just a break up Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady Cause I raised you better gotta keep it together Even when you fall apart But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart  Powder your nose paint your toes Line your lips and keep em closed Cross your legs dot your eyes And never let em see you cry  Go and fix your make up girl it’s just a break up Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady Cause I raised you better gotta keep it together Even when you fall apart But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart

The talk rap slow flow is personal and poetic He combines crooning with curses effortlessly and elevates the track in doing so The beat builds like a film He even directed his idol Pharrell’s angelic voice on the bridge with a melody Tyler created himself Sonically this track was standout and then he made that video and this became undeniably next level 34 Jay Z “Tom Ford”33 J Cole “Crooked Smile” ft TLC32 Kendrick Lamar “Bitch Dont Kill My Vibe Remix” ft Jay Z 31 Chance The Rapper “Acid Rain” 30 Childish Gambino “Telegraph Ave (Oakland)”Perhaps the universal favorite from the album this is a dark entrancing look at the compulsive and haunting power of our past loves/infatuations Like The Boy driving down Telegraph Ave we can spend our time retreading the same roads thinking about “what ifs” and reminiscing about things lost – sometimes alongside the people with whom we lost them But unless we decide to do something about all those lost things – whether to try again or to walk away for good – all that wandering isn’t going to do us any good Using Lloyd’s “Oakland” literally in the song Gambino cleverly plays both rapper and listener creating and experiencing the track with us29 Tyler the Creator “Rusty” ft Domo Genesis & Earl Sweatshirt28 Chance The Rapper “Favorite Song” ft Childish Gambino27 A$AP Ferg “Work (Remix)” ft A$AP Rocky French Montana SchoolBoy Q & Trinidad James 26 Pusha T “King Push” 25 Chance The Rapper “Juice”The first single off Acid Rap Juice was one of the big breakthroughs this year for Chance The first thing that catches your ears is Chance’s sing songy cartoony flow which you can’t help singing along to (some jumping around is mandatory) But listen closely and you get Chancelor’s dope bars: dense great sounding internal rhymes and clever Chicago references As you’re headbanging through the verse though you’re hit with that absolutely HYPE chorus that is guaranteed to make you lose your shit What you’re left with is one of the catchiest most memorable songs of 2013 and a high point in the spectacular year Chance has had24 Drake “Hold On Were Going Home” ft Majid Jordan23 A$AP Ferg “Shabba” ft A$AP Rocky22 J Cole “Let Nas Down”21 Eminem “Berzerk20 Drake “Worst Behavior”This Nothing Was The Same stand out combines Drizzy’s loud arrogant hook with even more flexin’ in his verses DJ Dahi delivers with gritty bass heavy production deceptively containing no sample Like many tracks on NWTS Drake’s flow and the beat changes up across the song    he even confidently borrows flow and bars from Ma$e’s “Mo Money Mo Problems” anthem The music video stars his actual dad and uncles and contains his worst skit to date Even with lyrics that playfully reference his famous Hot 97 freestyle blunder and remind us of his Degrassi roots Drake manages to make one of the hardest bangers of 2013 Just accept that you’ll never get the timing right for that initial “WORST!”19 Earl Sweatshirt “Hive” ft Vince Staples & Casey VeggiesThe leaps and bounds of growth that Earl Sweatshirt has experienced over the last several years can really be heard on Doris standout track “Hive” Fueled by a bassline that gives the song that dark Odd Future feel Earl spits much more mature bars using his now polished signature flow With the addition of a great hook from young Casey Veggies the song was already fantastic But then Vince Staples busts in with a ski mask and absolutely kills it Did Vince renegade Earl Thats up for debate but you cant deny that Shyne and everyone else on the song absolutely did their thing18 Eminem “Love Game” ft Kendrick LamarWhen the MMLP2 tracklist was revealed Love Game was one of the most heavily anticipated tracks; everyone was envisioning a Renegade level back and forth between Em and Kendrick But the song turned out to be as left field as possible Backed by a quirky Rick Rubin produced instrumental that could’ve come straight from the ‘50s (cheesy sample included) Eminem describes his time with an unfaithful woman in hilarious detail while Kendrick emulates Em’s flow and raps about his experiences with the infamous Sherane Although a largely comical song Love Game still has a lot of great rhymes with an especially phenomenal third verse by Em Despite their bad experiences with women Marshall and KDot let us know that they’re always going to be playing the game of love! 17 Drake “Started From The Bottom” “Started From The Bottom” produced by Mike Zombie was the first single off Drakes Nothing Was The Same album The track was released in February and peaked at #6 on the US Billboard Hot 100 It has since been certified 2x Platinum Some may doubt if Drake really did ‘start at the bottom’ but with 22 million pageviews on Rap Genius and one of the catchiest hooks of the year there is no doubt that this track was one of the biggest anthems of 201316 Childish Gambino “3005”The lead single for Because the Internet is quintessential Childish Gambino but is also a great showcase for the artist’s development over the last two years It’s a good sampling of the album’s overall sound and texture Gambino paints a great picture of how if you don’t have someone you really care about beside you you can be completely alone in a crowded room to say nothing of dealing with the rest of the shit life throws at you He both raps and sings exceptionally well and effortlessly here Gambino also gave us a pleasantly metaphorical video to accompany the song and make us think even more 15 Chance The Rapper “Cocoa Butter Kisses” ft Vic Mensa & TwistaTwo generations of Chicago hip hop converge on this mixtape cut with one artist already garnering national attention introducing another to the scene and re introducing an OG from his city Vic steals the show with an urgent and unforgiving verse and Chance happily cedes the spotlight to him restraining himself to an unassumingly spry and sing songy verse; Twista on the other hand is not quite so willing to take a back seat successfuly lacing the track with his trademark double time bars But amidst the aggressively fast raps of the trio the hook has a contrastingly soothing melody that rounds out the entire production This track firmly announces that hip hop is once again Chicagoan 14 Jay Z “Holy Grail” ft Justin TimberlakeIn a year of nervy choices that made business headlines around the world Jay Zs boldest decision was actually a musical one The only voice you hear during the first 1:19 of his new albums leadoff track is not Hov but rather Justin Timberlake This only manages to build anticipation so that we are well primed for the rappers entryAnd what an entry it is His daughters name is literally the first word out of his mouth and with good reason A post fatherhood Jay is contemplative about the ups and downs of a personified fame while admitting ultimately that he cant leave it alone And lest we think hes lost a step his patented wordplay is in full effect with a pun on pigeons that puts todays coke rappers to shame13 ASAP Rocky “1 Train” ft Kendrick Lamar Joey Badass Yelawolf Danny Brown Action Bronson and Big KRIT 1 Train is the cypher to end all cyphers A$AP Rocky amalgamated a line up without a single weak spitter and they all did their worst to this Hit Boy produced banger Its impossible to pick who delivered the best verse here: was it the energized Danny Brown the lovable braggart Action Bronson the wordsmith Joey Bad the hard driving Big KRIT Someone else I cant decide but I do know this: the track is flames 12 Schoolboy Q “Collard Greens” Kendrick LamarA cut between two of Top Dawg Entertainments main artists Schoolboy Q and Kendrick Lamar came in to make a party banger just in time for summer Schoolboy Q delivers a solid verse about his favorite things (and how other people cant have them) before Kendrick comes in with that Español that makes this verse so memorable The hook might be a little random but the vibe it generates makes it infectious upon first listen11 Kanye West “ Black Skinhead”When word dropped that Daft Punk would be working with Kanye West on his new album it was fair to assume it would result in a genre blending song like Stronger What we ended up with was indeed a blend of genres but instead of electronic synths and filtered vocals we got primal screams and distorted 808’s Kanye is pissed off but not the kind of pissed he gets about croissants or Jimmy Kimmel No Ye is fed up with people questioning his choices and he’s frustrated that nobody is taking risks anymore And it’s palpable in this song which represents the rebellious IDGAF attitude that flows from both Kanye and Yeezus Using few else but drums and vocal sounds you’d more likely hear exploring the Amazon than in Hip Hop Kanye crafts an uneasy raw instrumental that pairs perfectly with his blunt lyrics10 J Cole “Power Trip” ft MiguelIn classic J Cole fashion nearly everything on this track is done by himself The smooth voice of Miguel helps out on a hook but otherwise it is Cole’s world The incredibly catchy hooks match up perfectly with his production and he drops plenty of relatable bars about a crush This continuation of his 2009 song “Dreams” is about not only a girl but also hip hop and its impact on him   giving an already impressive song some duality And much like the song sounds its video felt like a short film as Cole literally does whatever it takes to claim his love The 10th most viewed song on RG in 2013 fans spent a combined 75 years of time on this song page!09 Drake “Pound Cake/Paris Morton Music 2” ft Jay ZDrake crafts one of the most memorable tracks of 2013 with the outro to his third studio LP Nothing Was The Same Boi 1da delivers on Pound Cake with a spacey Ellie Goulding sample as Drizzy paints the picture about what his life has been like while recording and making the albumThe song isn’t finished there by any means After two Jay verses Drake comes back in for Paris Morton Music 2 and a perfect verse to remind us this is his song The extra long PMM 2 verse is also very personal looking back on the landscape of  his career and perhaps how he’s no longer the same 08 Pusha T “Numbers On The Boards” My Name Is My Name is a stark minimalist creation and with the “No Artwork” cover “Numbers On The Boards” is the centerpiece Don Cannon & Kanye West create the spine with King Push on his super Lupe raps in between catchy samples Push said all year he wanted to bring “that feeling back” and “Numbers On The Boards” knocks harder than him thumping the wall with his fist The lyrically enthralling track is jam packed with references and double entendres that takes you to Pusha’s dark underground hell in only a way he could07 “Kanye West   Bound 2” ft Charlie Wilson “Bound 2” was an unexpected but wholly welcome ending to Yeezus The song has sparked wide discussion: is it a rejection of the past 37 minutes Is it a reassurance to fans about Kanye’s present musical identity Is it a revelation about Kanye’s future Who really cares Kanye fans who hated Yeezus loved it and Kanye fans who loved Yeezus loved it “Bound 2” is a weirdly endearing love song featuring classic Kanye flow floating over soul samples topped with Charlie Wilson’s magical voice What’s not to like! Well many would actually say “the video” which was an overtly cheesy green screened steamy motorcycle ride that not only made the world cringe but also felt like the furthest thing from Ye’s aesthetic But that was the point Ye geniusly defied our expectations and used his prettiest song’s video as a commentary on the “wack” quality of American art and media that he feels should be banned How very New Slaves of him06 Eminem “Bad Guy”Sequels to much loved properties are rarely a good idea For every The Empire Strikes Back there are three Matrix Reloadeds  So when word leaked out that Em had recorded a follow up to his epic 2000 story song “Stan” fans were nervous  After all Stan died at the end right So what’s leftPlenty as it turns out  Marshall turned a potentially bad idea into fantastic art with his imagining of Stan’s little brother Matthew (with the autographed Starter cap) now all grown up and seeking revenge  But just as the tale reaches its apex the song switches perspective revealing an intense look at Eminem’s self doubts and anguish Just before the end he drops the biggest gem of all: his in song tormentors are “just symbolic/Of not knowing what you had ‘til it’s gone”  The rapper himself may not know but trust us Slim we do05 Pusha T “Nosetalgia” ft Kendrick LamarThis genre defining song starts with a dirty Nottz beat that makes you feel like committing a crime and quickly escalates to the feeling you’re part of one The KRS sample serves as the hook and sounds of scratches fill the airwaves Kings Push & Kendrick come through with menacing delivery and complex wordplay While Terrence is neck deep in dealing Kendrick is in the midst of consumption   the contrast is phenomenal both MC’s affected by the crack epidemic in opposing instances The insight into Kendrick’s story is rare the Compton native always let us ride around his house but never let us through the front door “Nosetalgia” is your 8ball on a Friday night 4 shots of espresso every morning and the In N Out double double you crave in LA It’s dope 04 Kanye West “Blood On The Leaves” Blood On The Leaves introduces a new piece into the emotional puzzle of Yeezus: remorse The song is drowning in so many feels it’s impossible not to catch some yourself Kanye’s autotuned story of sadness begins atop the somber piano of the beautifully chopped Strange Fruit sample but then the blaring horns and bass of TNGHT’s R U Ready burst through and all of a sudden that sadness turns to rage By the end of it all you’re left with a modern day power ballad with enough autotune and raw emotion to make Future blush Blood On The Leaves got to a bit of a slow start on Rap Genius due to lack of exposure pre album release but thanks in part to Kanye’s emotionally charged VMA performance the song is one of the most viewed Yeezus tracks on the site The song’s instrumental has also become one of Producer Genius’ prized breakdowns explaining the use of the song’s controversial Nina Simone sample and the origin of that beat drop Can you imagine if Yeezus started off with this song like Kanye originally planned The world would have imploded03 Eminem “Rap God” ”Six minutes Slim Shady you’re on” After the novelty of a second Marshall Mathers LP began to wear off Eminem got the buzz back by becoming the third MC this year to proclaim himself a god This rapid fire lyrical tour de force is laced with references to the first Mathers LP sneak disses to some of his old buddies and a 17 second stretch crammed with over 100 words The Detroit native also broke Rap Genius the day Rap God was released and has now amassed over 4 million page views Proving himself in the booth was just the beginning for Slim After criticism he lip synced on live television Marshall Mathers showed up to the YouTube music awards and destroyed the hopes and dreams of every rapper alive when he performed the song live It’s safe to say Rap God proved the internal rhyme mastermind is back on his Pharoahe Monch grind and nothing’s going to stop him02 Big Sean “Control” ft Kendrick Lamar & Jay ElectronicaYou all knew this was coming Big Sean delivered a 3 minute dope verse to open the track Comparing his rapping skill to a babys first steps and reminiscing on his grandfather he manages to give one of the best verses of his career For obvious reasons well skip to Jay Electronica next He too spit a clean verse about religion while sneaking in TV and car references and even mentioning his late grandmother much like Sean did However there was a 3rd feature to this monster track produced by No ID His name King Kendrick Lamar He came with one purpose: to assassinate the competition The lyrical warfare was on for all to see and was full of levels The Compton MC proclaimed he was both 2Pacs offspring and the King of New York causing mass hysteria in hip hop’s homeland But oh no it wasn’t over yet His braggadocio left mouths agape as he goes on to say he is as popular as the Beatles and placed his name up for one of the greatest MCs of all time And yet there was morehe called out every hot young rapper   by their name a rarity in Hip Hop (no sneak disses here!) Basically Kendrick manages to piss off every rapper and revolutionize the rap game at the same damn time How about it 01 Kanye West “New Slaves” ft Frank Ocean New Slaves is best described as an “open letter” from Kanye West to the people   made into music Produced by the Very GOOD Beats crew New Slaves is sonically simplistic yet still possesses melody courtesy of the droning synths Frank Ocean assists on the outro providing an amazing contrast to the aggressive tone used throughout the song acting in a reflective manner However from a lyrical standpoint it’s without a doubt one of Kanye’s greatest songs He labeled verse 2 as the “best verse of all time” and with topics that range from modern day slavery to the fashion industry and even Americas prison system it’s hard to disagree The Chi town native doesn’t just stop at the music With a guerrilla marketing scheme fit for a military coup Ye projected the track onto buildings in 66 locations across the world It’s been 8 months since the song’s release and the significance of ”New Slaves is only just surfacing Between the time of the song’s release and present day the attitude of multiple industries has started to shift dramatically   would Jay Z and Beyonce have released projects with such unorthodox promotion methods if Kanye didn’t do it first His movement spearheaded with this peoples anthem was made to inspire others to think in a similar light ”New Slaves” invokes the power of free speech and brandishing the truth like an axe Kanye challenges listeners to think outside the Matrix Just as Mandela blew up the buildings and eventually became president Contrary to popular opinion sometimes you have to blow up the building— Kanye West
