1,I found a love for me Oh darling just dive right in and follow my lead Well I found a girl beautiful and sweet Oh I never knew you were the someone waiting for me Cause we were just kids when we fell in love Not knowing what it was I will not give you up this time But darling just kiss me slow your heart is all I own And in your eyes youre holding mine  Baby Im dancing in the dark with you between my arms Barefoot on the grass listening to our favourite song When you said you looked a mess I whispered underneath my breath But you heard it darling you look perfect tonight  Well I found a woman stronger than anyone I know She shares my dreams I hope that someday Ill share her home I found a love to carry more than just my secrets To carry love to carry children of our own We are still kids but were so in love Fighting against all odds I know well be alright this time Darling just hold my hand Be my girl Ill be your man I see my future in your eyes  Baby Im dancing in the dark with you between my arms Barefoot on the grass listening to our favorite song When I saw you in that dress looking so beautiful I dont deserve this darling you look perfect tonight   Baby Im dancing in the dark with you between my arms Barefoot on the grass listening to our favorite song I have faith in what I see Now I know I have met an angel in person And she looks perfect I dont deserve this You look perfect tonight

82,Ich bin im Tief gewesen Ich hab mir Zeit gelassen Ich fühle mich als hab ich meinen Verstand verloren Es fühlt sich an als wäre mein Leben nicht meins Wer kann es verstehen Ich bin im Tief gewesen Ich hab mir Zeit gelassen Ich fühle mich als hab ich meinen Verstand verloren Es fühlt sich an als wäre mein Leben nicht meins  Ich will nicht lebendig sein Ich will nicht lebendig sein Ich will heute einfach sterben Ich will einfach sterben Ich will nicht lebendig sein Ich will nicht lebendig sein Ich will einfach sterben Und lass mich dir sagen warum  All der andere Scheiß über den ich rede sie denken sie wissen es Ich habe gebetet damit mich jemand rettet keiner ist heldenhaft Und mein  Leben bedeutet nichts Ich weiß es ich weiß es ich weiß dass ich tief in mir verletzt bin aber kann es nicht zeigen Ich hatte nie einen Ort den ich mein Eigen nennen konnte Ich hatte nie ein Zuhause Keiner ruft mein Handy an Wo warst du Wo bist du Was geht in dir vor Sie sagen jedes Leben ist wertvoll doch interessiert sich für meins  Ich bin im Tief gewesen Ich hab mir Zeit gelassen Ich fühle mich als hab ich meinen Verstand verloren Es fühlt sich an als wäre mein Leben nicht meins Wer kann es verstehen Ich bin im Tief gewesen Ich hab mir Zeit gelassen Ich fühle mich als hab ich meinen Verstand verloren Es fühlt sich an als wäre mein Leben nicht meins  Ich will dass du lebendig bist Ich will dass du lebendig bist Du musst heute nicht sterben Du musst nicht sterben Ich will dass du lebendig bist Ich will dass du lebendig bist Du musst heute nicht sterben Jetzt lass mich dir sagen warum  Es ist der erste Atemzug Wenn dein Kopf im Wasser untergegangen ist Und die Leichtheit in der Luft Wenn du da bist Brust zu Brust mit einem Geliebten Es ist Weitermachen auch wenn der Weg lang ist Und Licht in den dunkelsten Dingen zu sehen Und wenn du deine Reflektion anstarrst Endlich zu wissen wer es ist Ich weiß dass du Gott danken wirst dass du es getan hast  Ich weiß wo du warst wo du bist wohin du gehst Ich wieß dass du der Grund bist warum ich ans Leben glaube Was ist der Tag mit einer kleinen Nacht Es kann schwer sein Es kann so schwer sein Aber du musst jetzt leben Du musst jetzt alles geben  Ich bin im Tief gewesen Ich hab mir Zeit gelassen Ich fühle mich als hab ich meinen Verstand verloren Es fühlt sich an als wäre mein Leben nicht meins Wer kann es verstehen Ich bin im Tief gewesen Ich hab mir Zeit gelassen Ich fühle mich als hab ich meinen Verstand verloren Es fühlt sich an als wäre mein Leben nicht meins  Ich will endlich lebendig sein Ich will endlich lebendig sein Ich will heute nicht sterben Ich will nicht sterben Ich will endlich lebendig sein Ich will endlich lebendig sein Ich will nicht sterben Ich will nicht sterben  Schmerz tut nicht so weh ich weiß Die Spur die ich fahre fühlt sich einsam an Aber ich bewege mich bis meine Beine aufgeben Und ich sehe meine Tränen im Schnee schmelzen Aber ich will nicht weinen Ich will nicht mehr weinen Ich will mich lebendig fühlen Ich will sogar nicht mehr sterben Oh ich will nicht Ich will nicht Ich will sogar nicht mehr sterben
